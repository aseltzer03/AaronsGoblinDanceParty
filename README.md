Steps Completed - 6/6

When did I commit - I committed and pushed after finishing each step.

How many commits/pushs I executed - 7

Troubles with GitHub/the assignment - I didn't have much trouble with GitHub; it was mostly small issues with the assignment.

Ai use - in areas that it made sense and to save time I used autofill and asked Copilot for help when I was making the colour list because I forgot even though it was a list type it was still case sensitive and I was putting List<color> instead of List<Color>.
